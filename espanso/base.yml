# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement

  - trigger: "sig."
    replace: "--\nTurtleTough42"

  - trigger: "teh"
    replace: "the"
    word: true
  
  - trigger: "tehm"
    replace: "them"
    word: true

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:
  
  # Print my ip addresses
  - trigger: ":ip"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "powershell -Command \"Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object IPAddress -NotLike '169.*' | Where-Object PrefixOrigin -NE 'WellKnown' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty IPAddress\""

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%B %d, %Y"
